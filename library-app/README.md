This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Environment Setup

This project requires several environment variables to function properly. These should never be committed to the repository.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in the actual values in `.env.local`
3. Place your Google Cloud service account JSON file in a secure location and reference it in your environment

### Sensitive Data

The following files are automatically excluded from Git:
- `.env.local` and all other `.env.*` files (except `.env.example`)
- Google Cloud service account JSON files
- Any files containing credentials or API keys

Never commit sensitive data to the repository. If you accidentally expose sensitive data:
1. Immediately revoke the exposed credentials
2. Generate new credentials
3. Update your local `.env.local` with the new values
